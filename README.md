# NetLogo-Labs
This is where I drop all my NetLogo labs once I've completed them for my Intro to Computer Modeling Class

Almost all of these are completed fully, I'm aware that the Maze one isn't quite done and some of them
have missing info tabs. This was just because I procrastinated and wrote them only 2 hours before they were due.
